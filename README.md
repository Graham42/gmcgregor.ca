# Graham's website

This repo is the source for https://gmcgregor.ca

This site is built using [Remix][]! The site scales down so it even works fully
without JavaScript in the browser, but with all the great developer experience
of building with modern tooling.

[remix]: https://remix.run/

There's some magic that isn't defined in `vercel.json` because Vercel configures
a bunch of stuff by using the Remix framework preset. See
https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/build-step
