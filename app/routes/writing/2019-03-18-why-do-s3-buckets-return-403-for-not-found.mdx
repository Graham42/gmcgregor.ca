# Why do S3 Buckets Return 403 for Not Found?

We're going to dig in to why AWS has taken a strange stance on the status code
returned for a file that doesn't exist in an S3 bucket. You may have observed
that if you have permissions to _read_ from a bucket, but not to _list_ the
contents of the bucket, then you will get `403 Forbidden` instead of
`404 Not Found`.

## TDLR: AWS Quick Fix

If you want to get the proper `404` status for AWS S3, you need to give the user
or role the `s3:ListBucket` permission.

## Preventing a Leak

It's starts with security.

Enumeration attacks are where the attacker is able to make the target list the
resources available. A resource name itself might contain sensitive information.
Or the existence of a certain file can indicate what software is running on a
server that would provide the attacker with a new attack vector to try.

To prevent enumeration attacks, we don't want the user to know whether the
resource doesn't exist, or the resource exists and they do not have permission
to view it. The solution is to return the same status code for both cases to
prevent leaking information.

## `403` vs `404`?

If we look at the [403 status code spec][403 spec] we see:

> "If the server does not wish to make [why the request has not been fulfilled]
> available to the client, the status code 404 (Not Found) can be used instead."

And in the [404 status code spec][404 spec] there is nothing suggesting that 403
should be returned instead.

[403 spec]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.3
[404 spec]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4

My guess would be that AWS has some legacy reason for always returning `403`
instead of always returning `404` and is choosing to keep backwards
compatibility over spec compliance.

## Conclusion

The result of the AWS S3 behavior is that properly configured S3 buckets can
prevent enumeration attacks, which is good.

For your own APIs you should not replicate the AWS S3 behavior. Instead, always
return `404 Not Found`.
